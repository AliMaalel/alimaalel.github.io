<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</strong></p>

<p><mark>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</mark></p>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. </p>
<p>Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.</p>
<p>You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.</p>
<p>If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
