<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</strong></p>

<p><mark>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</mark></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p><i>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</i></p>
<p><i>175g of tahini</i></p>
<p><i>6 sundried tomatoes</i></p>
<p><i>Half a red pepper</i></p>
<p><i>A pinch of cayenne pepper</i></p>
<p><i>1 clove of garlic</i></p>
<p><i>A dash of olive oil</i></p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. </p>
<p>Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.</p>
<p>You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.</p>
<p>If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
